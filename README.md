# Website V2
This is repository is a copy of the source code of my personal website (www.lorencanderson.com).

## Technical Description
This website was redone with intention of producing a much simpler UI and yet show case more of my technical skills. The entirety of the website was completed in html, css, and javascript. The "Technical Skills" portion of the website utilizes the GitHub API to fetch all of my public repositories to showcase the title, the creation date, the language used, and a quick description of the projects.

## Project Background
Overall, the end goal of redoing the website is to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, along the way, I wanted to make the UI much more simplicist and more accurate representation of myself.
