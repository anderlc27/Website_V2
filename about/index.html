                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Where I Was</h2>
                    <p>Growing up in the greater Seattle area, I have been exposed to two things: music and technology. Since the age of 9, I have been playing music; I've played drums in multiple bands, was captain of my high school drumline, and am now honing my guitar playing abilities. Needless to say, music has been a major part of my life. Although music was present throughout most of my life, technology was one of the main constants. Ever since I was young, I have been facinated by technology. I remember watching the show Power Rangers as a kid and wanting to build one of those awesome machines that battled the monsters at the end of every episode. Furthermore, when I got into music, I realized that almost everything is centered around tech; guitars used amplifiers to produce sound; microphones were used by vocalists and acoustic instruments; samples were played by keyboardists and drums; and the list goes on and on.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Where I Am</h2>
                    <p>As a Computer Engineering major at Gonzaga University, I have received exposure and comprehension to Circuit Analysis, and Computer Science Fundamentals(using C++ and MATLAB), such as dynamic programming and object-oriented programming; as well as introduction to programming computer hardware. However, since the spring semester of my freshman year, I have further explored the ideas and principles of programming through learning the basics of web development, as well as front-end implementation using JavaScript. Furthermore, regarding the hardware aspect of computer engineering, I have gained experience in soldering, as well as experience with working with schematics.</p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Where I'm Going</h2>
                    <p>As of now, I am in my junior year and anticipate to graduate in May 2021. I hope to enter the realm of human-computer interaction and help make the lives of other people easier. With the technology that I develop, I hope to make to take off the stress of others such that they can focus less on trivial tasks and more on big picture situations. </p>
